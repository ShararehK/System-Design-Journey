# My System Design Journey

Welcome to my System Design Journey repository! ðŸš€ This space is a compilation of my preparation for interviews, aiming to condense essential system design concepts into a comprehensive and accessible resource.

## Purpose
As I got ready for interviews, I needed a centralized place to organize my understanding of system design principles. This repository serves as a dedicated resource, offering a condensed yet thorough overview of crucial concepts essential for excelling in system design interviews.

## Key Resource
The backbone of this journey is the course "Grokking Modern System Design Interview for Engineers & Managers" by Educative. The insights gained from this course heavily influence the content here, making it a valuable reference for anyone diving into the realm of system design.

## Sharing Knowledge
The primary motivation behind creating this repository is to share knowledge. Whether you're a seasoned engineer, a manager, or someone gearing up for interviews, this repository aims to simplify complex concepts and provide a clear, concise overview. I invite you to explore, contribute, and use this repository as a companion in your own quest to master modern system design.

## My Learning Path

### 1. Introduction:

#### Why System Design Matters

1.  **Interview Preparation:** System design interviews are becoming increasingly common in the tech industry. Companies, especially the big players like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, use these interviews to assess a candidate's ability to design scalable and efficient systems.

2.  **Real-world Application:** Beyond interviews, a solid grasp of system design principles is essential for building robust and scalable software in the real world. It's about creating systems that can handle growth, provide a seamless user experience, and adapt to changing requirements.

3.  **Career Advancement:** Whether you're aiming for senior roles, technical leadership, or even starting your own venture, a deep understanding of system design distinguishes you as a tech professional. It's a skill set that opens doors to exciting career opportunities.

#### What is System Design?

**System design is the process of defining components and their integration, APIs, and data models to build large-scale systems that meet a specified set of functional and non-functional requirements. System design uses the concepts of computer networking, parallel computing, and distributed systems to craft systems that scale well and are performant.**

In simpler terms, it involves making decisions on how to structure software to meet specific needs, considering factors like scalability, reliability, and performance.

#### How to Navigate the System Design Interview

1.  **Understand the Basics:** Start by familiarizing yourself with the fundamental concepts such as scalability, data storage, and system architecture. This forms the foundation for more advanced discussions.

2.  **Practice, Practice, Practice:** Nothing beats hands-on practice. Work on real-world scenarios, design projects, or take on coding challenges related to system design.

3.  **Learn from Others:** Explore case studies of successful systems, understand their architectures, and learn from both their successes and failures.

4.  **Stay Updated:** The tech industry evolves rapidly. Stay informed about the latest trends, technologies, and best practices in system design.

#### Who Should Study System Design?

1.  **Software Engineers:** For those actively involved in coding and building software.

2.  **Interviewees:** If you're gearing up for technical interviews, especially with top tech companies.

3.  **Tech Enthusiasts:** If you simply enjoy delving into the intricacies of how systems work and want to level up your technical skills.
